Pipeline Annotation 
=============

## Group (Subgroup) ##

Core (Misc)

## Description ##

This filter is used to add an annotation to a pipeline in the form of a basic text input box. The user of the pipeline can type as much as they want to describe the the pipeline or section of the pipeline. There can be more than one instance of the filter in a pipeline. A simple formatting like Markdown could be used by the pipeline developer to allow some formatting when the pipeline is read in by other tools.

*Please Note*: The information from the text box is _not_ stored in a data set in the .dream3d file but is stored purely in the pipeline file.
